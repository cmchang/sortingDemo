sortingDemo
===========

demoData.tsv contains all the data displayed on the graph.

bubbleSort.js keeps an array for all the intermediate states of the increasing-order bubble sort, which is the same as an bubbleSort_increase.js, while bubbleSort_decrease.js keeps all the intermediate states for the decreasing-order bubble sort.

insertSort.js keeps an array for all the intermediate states of the increasing-order insertion sort, which is the same as an insertSort_increase.js, while insertSort_decrease.js keeps all the intermediate states for the decreasing-order bubble sort.

all .py files are used to generate the bubbleSort_increase.js, bubbleSort_decrease.js, insertSort_increase.js, and insertSort_decrease.js.

sortingDemo.html is our homepage which links to sortingDemoBubble.html and sortingDemoInsert.html.

sortingDemo.css is for embellishing components of our webpage.
